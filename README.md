# build a base
 build a base and defend against waves of fiends and monsters, collect epic loot and battle giant bosses! 
# Instructions
 after you have cloned the repository you can import the project by opening godot then choosing the 'import' option and select the file named 'project.godot'. In orer to test the game you will have to open the scene 'game.tscn' and hit test. You might not be able to do anything and that's ok, it means your input map isn't set up. Go to project > input map and add the following actions : 
 "move_right", "move_left", "move_up", "move_down", "crouch", "sprint", "open_inventory". **All without the quotes and lowercase.** You need to assign keys to these actions. These are the buttons you will have to press in order for a specific action to trigger. You may assign whatever keys you like or you may use this control scheme I camed up with :  
 move_right -> arrow right, d  
 move_left -> arrow left, a  
 move_up -> arrow up, w  
 move_down -> arrow down, s  
 crouch -> ctrl  
 sprint -> shift  
 open_inventory -> esc  
   
   **NOTE** : these actions do not need to be added in any particular order  
   **PS** : press space to witness the lifebar in action!
